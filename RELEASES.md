- support for [add-sqs-event-source](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/docs/add-sqs-event-source.md)
- better handling of KMS timeouts when creating a function and setting environment variables at the same time
- removed shelljs as a dependency from the project, which reduces file size and makes it easier to maintain the code

### 5.0.1 

- bug fix for add-cognito-user-pool-trigger, when user pool has custom domain, thanks to [Christian Sepulveda](https://github.com/csepulv)
- better error handling when a config file is requested for an invalid directory

### 5.0.0 7 June 2018

- use `--npm-options` to pass additional options to NPM when installing packages. Useful to specify behaviour for package locking.
- packaging using NPM 6 is now faster as audits are turned off by default
- packaging support for NPM 5 and 6 using relative file dependencies -- this previously worked only with NPM 3 because NPM 5 uses symbolic links for relative references
- upload size optimised using for NPM 5 and 6 by deduping dependencies after packaging
- use `--post-package-script=<NPM SCRIPT NAME>` with `claudia create` or `claudia update` to execute a custom post-package step to clean up resources, optimise package size etc. This runs after all validations are complete, and development dependencies are not available at this stage... but you can use npm to uninstall utility tools as part of this step if needed.
- new command. [`claudia pack`](docs/pack.md) just packages the files, correctly handling NPM dependencies, without deploying anywhere. Useful for troubleshooting, or if you want to deploy to Lambda using some other tool but get Claudia to prepare the package for you. This is specially useful for CloudFormation deployments if you want to use NPM 5 or 6. The command works with any Node.js Lambda project, not just Claudia-specific ones. 
- claudia automatically fixes file access permissions in your package that would prevent Lambda from running code.
- NPM output is now directly written to the console, rather than a separate log file, to make packaging errors more obvious
- (for newly created functions only) claudia destroy will not delete a role if it was created using --role

### 4.0.0 9 April 2018

- compatibility with Node.js 8.10 and NPM 5
- fix for package-lock.json and --no-optional-dependencies when using NPM 5
- Claudia now creates new functions using the node8.10 Lambda runtime by default 
- more resilient waiting on IAM propagation when patching existing roles for VPC access

### 3.4.0 23 March 2018

- added tag command to assist with Lambda tagging, thanks to [Mohamed Osama](https://github.com/oss92)

### 3.3.1 29 January 2018

- bugfix for CORS setup with path params
- enable generate-serverless-express to handle binary content

### 3.3.0 27 January 2018

- support for using server-side encryption for code uploads to s3, thanks to [Ricky Blaha](https://github.com/rickyblaha)

### 3.2.0 12 January 2018

- support for Kinesis Data Stream triggers with [`add-kinesis-event-source`](docs/add-kinesis-event-source.md)

### 3.1.0 11 January 2018

- support for request based custom API Gateway Authorisers

### 3.0.0 4 January 2018

- support for deploying to Lambda@Edge with [`set-cloudfront-trigger`](docs/set-cloudfront-trigger.md)
- support for generating quick start projects with [`generate`](docs/generate.md)
- support for configuring 3GB Lambda functions using `--memory`
- support for deploying custom [API Gateway Responses](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia-api-builder/blob/master/docs/customise-responses.md#api-gateway-responses)
- speed up API GW deployments by using a single handler for CORS OPTIONS instead of replicating it for each supported route
- fix for deploying lambdas with a VPC configuration and manually specified roles

This release is fully backwards compatible with 2.0 in terms of client code, but changes internal protocols between claudia API Builder and claudia, which is why we increased the major version. For API and bot deployments, this release requires Claudia API Builder 3.0.

### 2.14.0 23 June 2017

- support for `allow-alexa-skill-trigger` (thanks to [Slobodan Stojanovic](https://github.com/stojanovic))

### 2.13.0, 7 June 2017 

- `update` and `set-version` can now patch existing environment variables without replacing the entire set. use `--update-env` or `--update-env-from-json`
- `update` can now reconfigure several commonly requested options: `--timeout`, `--memory`, `--runtime` and `--handler`

### 2.12.0, 26 April 2017

- support `--proxy` in claudia to specify a HTTP proxy when working behind corporate firewalls (thanks to [Jason Riddle](https://github.com/jason-riddle))
- isolate claudia filesystem additions better to avoid clashes with third party libraries that also change fs objects, such as Nuxt (thanks to [Paweł Barszcz](https://github.com/nkoder))

### 2.11.1, 24 April 2017 

- bugfix for `AliasAttributes` removal when creating cognito user pool triggers, thanks [@matsnow](https://github.com/matsnow)

### 2.1.0, 5 October 2016

- support for `--generate-serverless-express-proxy`, helping users create aws-serverless-express wrappers.

### 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2 27 September 2016 

- support for --deploy-proxy-api

- stopping support for node 0.10

### 1.9.0, 21 September 2016

- Reuse code easier across different functions: Claudia can now work working with local relative dependencies in package.json (referencing relative directories on your disk)
- Use Claudia easier in storage-restricted environments, such as cloud continuous integration: Temporary files produced for packaging are now cleaned up automatically after deployment. Specify --keep with `create` or `update` to keep the zip files around for troubleshooting (claudia will print out the location of the archive in that case). (A huge thanks to [Philipp Holly](https://github.com/phips28))
- Use Claudia easier with low bandwidth and larger functions, and keep binary packages on S3 for auditing purposes: supply a S3 bucket name with `--use-s3-bucket <bucket-name>` when using `claudia create` or `claudia update` and Claudia will send a binary archive to S3 then install it to Lambda from there, instead of uploading code directly to Lambda. It will also print out the uploaded file key in the command results, so you can easily integrate it with auditing tools.

### 1.6.0, 2 August 2016

- API Gateway request support for `.normalizedHeaders`, containing a copy of the headers with lowercase header names, for easier processing

### 1.5.0, 29 July 2016

- support for setting custom credentials and passing on caller credentials with IAM and STS (thanks to [Conor Dockry](https://github.com/cdock1029))
